<p>There are different ways to get your plugin listed here. Every possibility
ends with contacting Dominic Hopf. He is the maintainer of this website and
takes care of uploading the HTML files and including new plugins into
navigation and so on.</p>
<div class="section" id="note">
<h3>Note</h3>
<p>If your plugin already is part of the Geany Plugins project, you should find
your plugin listed here. There is a cronjob running every night, which
updates the plugins.geany.org website with latest information from the
README files of the plugins. For this to work correctly, it is necessary
you have a README file in trunk/geany-plugins/{your plugin name}/ which is
written in restructuredText.</p>
<p>If the README file is there, but still not listed on the plugins.geany.org
website, make sure you gave the cronjob a chance to find your README and
wait a night before contacting Dominic to have a deeper look on the issue.</p>

<h3>1st Way</h3>
<ul class="simple">
<li>create a file {your plugin name}.html</li>
<li>edit the file manually, get inspired by the plugin sites already existing
and keep an eye on the validity of the HTML code. It should be XHTML 1.1 -
which is very strict.</li>
<li>when your HTML file is finished, contact Dominic by mail and send him
your file. He will do the rest for you.</li>
</ul>
</div>
<div class="section" id="nd-way">
<h3>2nd Way</h3>
<p>This one will only work, if you write your README file in restructuredText
as some other plugin authors do. You will need to use two tools: rst2html5
and HTML Tidy. Dominic wrote some configuration files for use with those
tools. If you do not have them yet, feel free to contact Dominic to get
them. The result should be an almost perfect HTML file which can be
included into the plugins.geany.org website. Do this steps to generate the
file:</p>
<blockquote>
rst2html5 --config=rst2html_config.conf README &gt; {your plugin name}.html
tidy -config tidy.conf {your plugin name}.html</blockquote>
<p>While {your plugin name} is the actual UNIX name (lowercase!) of your plugin.
Note: There is no need for HTML headers and body and so on. Those will be
provided by the website itself. Your HTML file should just provide pure
XHTML 1.1 validating content, it will appear within the body tags on the
plugins.geany.org website.</p>
<p>When you're done, have a look if your HTML file looks good (get some
inspiration from already existing plugin sites) and send it to Dominic then.</p>
