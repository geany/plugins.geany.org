<h2>Welcome</h2>

<p> What you will find here is a lot of plugin stuff for <a href=
"http://www.geany.org">Geany</a>. There is a <a href=
"https://sourceforge.net/projects/geany-plugins/">Geany Plugins project</a>
containing a lot of plugins, which is developed by various developers on <a
href="https://github.com/geany/geany-plugins">GitHub</a>. </p>

<p> Any plugin delivered with the Geany Plugins project is listed on the
left sidebar (Or rather any plugin providing a valid README file written in
reStructuredText. There are some plugins in an early development state, not
having such a README file yet.) </p>

<p> There also are some third party plugins for Geany. They are already
listed on the left navigation bar, but maybe content is missing, yet. Feel
free to kick our butts on IRC to complete also this pages and fill them with
information. </p>

<p>If you are searching for <em>any</em> plugin for Geany or information about
a plugin, this website is (or will be) the right place to get those
information.</p>

<p> The pages for any plugin delivered with the Geany Plugins project are
automatically generated by a shell script using <a href=
"http://docutils.sourceforge.net/">rst2html from doctools</a> and <a href=
"http://tidy.sourceforge.net/">HTML Tidy</a>. Basis for that are the README
files for each plugin, checked out and updated from <a href=
"https://github.com/geany/geany-plugins">Git</a>, so if you think there's
something wrong, you can feel free to <a href=
"https://sourceforge.net/tracker/?group_id=222729&amp;atid=1056532">report
issues</a> against the according plugin (or even this website) at <a href=
"https://sourceforge.net/tracker/?group_id=222729&amp;atid=1056532">
SourceForge</a>.<br />

The <a href= "https://github.com/geany/plugins.geany.org" >source code of
this script</a> (including the whole source for the plugins.geany.org
website itself) is available on <a href=
"https://github.com/geany/plugins.geany.org">GitHub</a> as well. </p>

<p>
If you are a plugin developer and wonder why your plugin is not listed here,
there may be several reasons for that:
</p>
<ul>
	<li>you didn't know of this site yet</li>
	<li>the maintainers of this site didn't know of your plugin yet</li>
	<li>your plugin is part of the Geany Plugins project, but</li>
	<li><ul>
		<li>you don't have a README file written in reStructuredText</li>
		<li>or your README file is empty</li>
		<li>or a README file doesn't even exist</li>
	</ul></li>
</ul>
<p>
For any of these reasons, you will find more detailed hints on the
<a href="index.php?site=README">List or update a plugin page</a>.
