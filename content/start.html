<h2>Welcome</h2>

<p>This site is the home page for <a href= "http://www.geany.org">Geany</a>
plugins. It includes official Geany Plugins, as well as 3rd party ones.</p>

<p>Some plugins may lack details. Feel free to add them yourself or ask 
<a href="https://www.geany.org/Support/IRC">on IRC</a> about them.</p>

<h3>Installation</h3>
See the <a href="install.html">Installation</a> page.

<h3>Developer details</h3>
<p>The code for the plugins from the Geany Plugins project is hosted
<a href="https://github.com/geany/geany-plugins">on GitHub</a>.</p>

<p>The details page for any plugin in the Geany Plugins project is
automatically generated by a shell script from the README file of the plugin,
using <a href="http://docutils.sourceforge.net/">rst2html from doctools</a>
and <a href="http://www.html-tidy.org/">HTML Tidy</a>. If you think there's
something wrong, feel free to report issues against the corresponding plugin
at <a href="https://github.com/geany/geany-plugins/issues">GitHub</a>.

<p>The <a href="https://github.com/geany/plugins.geany.org">source code of
this script</a> (including the whole source for the plugins.geany.org
website itself) is available <a href="https://github.com/geany/plugins.geany.org">
on GitHub</a> as well.</p>

<p>
If you are a plugin developer and wonder why your plugin is not listed here,
there may be several reasons for that:
</p>
<ul>
	<li>you didn't know of this site yet</li>
	<li>the maintainers of this site don't know about your plugin yet</li>
	<li>your plugin is part of the Geany Plugins project, but</li>
	<li><ul>
		<li>you don't have a README file written in reStructuredText</li>
		<li>or your README file is empty</li>
		<li>or a README file doesn't exist at all</li>
	</ul></li>
</ul>
<p>
For any of these reasons, you will find more detailed hints on the
<a href="README.html">List or update a plugin page</a>.
</p>
